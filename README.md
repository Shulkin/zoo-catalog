# zoo-catalog

## What's done

Simple catalog of items for some shop or gallery. Dogs, for example. MongoDB as database, simple CRUD. Carousel navigation.

* Select what you want to see (dogs or cats)
* Click item to view info card
* Add new item to list
* Delete from list by clicking remove glyph in item's top-right corner
* Edit params (name, age, breed) in info card by clicking on text fields

## What can be done better

1. Remove error when close modal window
2. Make modal window without third-party library, angular-style
3. Make disable call for nested ui-sref more angular-way, as directive
4. Add cats
5. Make edit fields neat and style
